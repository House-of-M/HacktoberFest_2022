The following repo includes my solutions to some of the lab sessions of the course LELEC2885:Image Processing and Computer Vision [UCLouvain]. 
The goal of this repo is to share the notebooks as an educational ressource as they include theoretical explanations aside from my code solutions.

- **Image_Processing_w_Fourrier:** This lab focusses on the convolution operation, which allows for the *application* of filters (kernels) on images. The fourrier transform is used to create a fast convolution operation, which consists on making the computations in the frequency domain instead of the pixel domain. The second topic is the Laplacian pyramid. LP is an overcomplete representation of an image which decomposes such image into a hierarchy of detail levels from which the original image can be reconstructed.
