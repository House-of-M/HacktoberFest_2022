The following notebook investigates the results of different machine learning models (namely linear svm, polynomial svm and random forests)for a binary classification of single cell expression data. The difficulty behind this task resides in the type of data. Indeed genetic data are of high volume and higher complexity as they capture tens of thousands of genes which can be crucial or useless to the task based on the pathology at hands. To gain a better understanding of the data, this work was partially inspired by applications of machine learning to the medical and biological field.
