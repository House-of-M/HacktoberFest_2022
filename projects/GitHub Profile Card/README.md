# GitHub Profile Card
This is a simple web project using html/css and vanilla javascript to learn how to use an API to search for any user profile.

Here the GitHub API is used to search and retrieve a user's public info and display them such as; name, avatar, number of followers, bio, projects ..etc

## Info
This project uses the GitHub API, see more here:
- [GitHub API - GitHub Developer](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
- [https://api.github.com/](https://api.github.com/)

Unlike the original project by insaaFusion, I upgraded this one to not just display plain info but to also link to the user's profile, projects, followers/following and achievements.
It only makes sense to be able to actually visit visit the user's profile to navigate on github website, this upgrade helps to do so.

## Setup
You can clone and open the project in a local server (e.g:  liveserver) or you can host it somewhere like GitHub pages.

## Contribution
This project itself serves as learning material to know how to handle an API. Still, you may want to add more features as part of your web dev learning journey, try to:
- Display user's achievements icons
- Add feature to print the user card
- Display a user's organizations on the card
- Make GitHub Organizations searchable (only user profiles are supported as of now)
